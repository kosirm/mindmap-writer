A few thoughts that might help:

 - Be more specific in requests - Instead of broad requests, try to be very specific about exactly what you need. This can reduce back-and-forth and the number of tool calls/tokens used.

- Batch related changes - Instead of asking for changes one at a time, group related changes into single requests when possible.

- Do more investigation yourself - Before asking me to search the codebase, if you already know where something is, just tell me the file and line numbers. The retrieval/search tools can be expensive.

- Use the IDE for simple edits - For straightforward changes where you know exactly what needs to change, doing it yourself in the IDE is free.

- Review context/history - The conversation history grows over time and gets summarized, but long conversations still accumulate cost. Starting fresh conversations for new topics can help.

- Check your plan - Augment has different pricing tiers. Make sure you're on the right plan for your usage, or check if there are options that better fit your needs.

- Contact Augment support - If the cost spike is unexpected/abnormal, reaching out to their support team might help identify if something unusual is happening with your account.
