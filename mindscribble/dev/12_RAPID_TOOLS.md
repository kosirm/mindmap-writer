# User Stories
With rapid tools, as a user, I can rapidly:

1. create new nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
2. navigate between nodes using arrow keys.
3. select multiple nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
4. move selected nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
5. resize selected nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
6. delete selected nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
7. connect nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
8. disconnect nodes using keyboard shortcuts and arrow keys.
9. edit node content using keyboard shortcuts.
10. expand/collapse nodes which have children using keyboard shortcuts.
11. switch between views/panels and continue working on the node in new view/panel using keyboard shortcuts.
12. expand/collapse panels using keyboard shortcuts.
13. select-navigate nodes in other views using keyboard shortcuts.

For this we will need a smart CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/SPACE/FN/TAB + ARROW key system which would work across all views (if view supports it). Occasionally we will need also other key combinations like CTRL/SHIFT/ALT + ARROW + KEY (like E for edit, C for connect, D for disconnect, etc.)

In mindmap/conceptmap we will also need to have a connection to map layout engine (if AABB is on).
