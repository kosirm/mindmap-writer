I'm still not happy with the top bar... - it is kinda strange - with icons left and right - and a lot of empty space in the middle. Ok, in the center I plan to put search, but anyway, it is not nice...

How can I open drawers and have login + dark/light icon somewhere else?
Ok maybe when I add toolbar - it will be better...
