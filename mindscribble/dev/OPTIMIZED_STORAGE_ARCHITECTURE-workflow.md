- app strartup:
- Do we have Internet?
  - If Yes then:
    - check if we have a local vault
      - if not, create a new local vault or open vault from drive (open, create buttons)
      - if yes, check google drive for vault sync timestamp
    - if update timestamp is the same as on local, we are good to go:
      - we already have a local vault, so we can open last opened files, etc.
    - if update timestamp is different, we need to:
      - update local vault from google drive
      - then open last opened files, etc.
  - No:
    - use local vault
