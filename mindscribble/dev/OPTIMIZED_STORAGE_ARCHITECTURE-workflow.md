- app strartup:
- If we have internet connection:
- we check google drive for vault sync timestamp
- if update timestamp is the same as on local, we are good to go:
- we already have a local vault, so we can open last opened files, etc.
- if update timestamp is different, we need to:
- update local vault from google drive
- if local vault is newer (working offline), we need to: update google drive with local vault
