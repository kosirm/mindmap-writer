### TODO

- Rapid map linking or node linking - create link to map or node in some map - very important feature !!!  
- Mind-Manager - linked maps... Map of the maps - central overview of connected maps - this can be done with D3 !!! This should be called Master Map - this map should be builded in background and saved in indexedDB  
- tabbed interface (for opening multiple maps in UI) - very nice idea, this can be somehow part of top bar (to save space)  
- MindManager uses a background image for maps like venn diagram,  Onion diagramm, Funnel Diagram, Matrix Diagram,etc.  
- since icons can take a lot of space, we need a smart way how to display them - for example in mindmap node there is not a lot of space... - ok MindManager displays them before the title... Which is reasonable (because we don't know how many user will use) - I would add left just icons, and bottom (or top) i would add actions (like kanban, date, etc)  
- show/hide icons - for each view  
- [ ] presentation view - automatic presentation generator (powerpoint) - PptxGenJS (fantastic library for this!!!)  
- [ ] KANBAN VIEW !!! based on TODO api - every node can have todo state attached and that way it can be inclueded in kanban view (https://github.com/ayazsayyed/vue-kanban) - this looks like PRO add-on (kanban, gantt,...)  
- [ ] GANTT VIEW !!! - https://github.com/zunnzunn/vue-ganttastic - this looks like PRO add-on (kanban, gantt,...)  
- [ ] PRESENTATION VIEW !!! - https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev (html slides) or https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS (powerpoint) this looks like PRO add-on (kanban, gantt, slides...)  
- [ ] Text selection custom color (tiptap) - both in writer and in mindmap (now it's default windows dark blue - ugly)  
- [ ] rapid actions - kanban (todo), date (start/end date), status,  etc.  
- [ ] MindManager inspiration - Priority, Progress, Kanban ... Icons Flags, Arrows, Smileys, Single icons - here we could use google icon library and for fonts we could use google fonts... That's it! We just need icon coloring and few icons for our actions which would be a bit different (some border and color)  
- Google icons have CATEGORIES (!!!) & style (sharp, rounded) + filed + weight, all that we need !!!! We just need to add colors to them! Same with fonts!!! For smileys there is Noto Color Emoji font (25 MB!!!)...  

### Mindmap


### Writer

- [ ] adjustable indent size in writer  
- [ ] rapid commands (should work also when in tiptat editor - which is 99% of the time in writer): - rapid node selection, - rapid node movement (up-down - in a flatten structure, left-right - indent/unindent), - rapid node splitting and merging (merging we could add also in mindmap). Node split is a killer feature - make sibling after, node merge - use first title, delete other titles.  
- Untitled should be colored gray both in mindmap and in Writer so we visuall see the difference between title and Untitled (sometning like Click to add content in Writer content - and that text should be also changed...)  
- deleting title in Writer (or in mindmap) should return title to Untitled  
- Clicking on root node does not navigate Writer to the top !!! Check
