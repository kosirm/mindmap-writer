vueflow

### Todo

- [ ] add custom node padding - so that user can set top/bottom/left/right padding for custom node (and this should be respected also by bounding boxes - which can have it's own padding)  
- [ ] add canvas context menu (add root)  
- [ ] remove node id from bounding box  
- [ ] when node height/width is uder 50/150, node bounding box is still 50/150 (!!!) - should be node height/width.  
- [ ] Parenting indicator should use two colors (gradient) - only on child side should be blue - on other side same as node background - so it is better indicator what we are doing - and root node should have gradients on both sides  
- [ ] root node can create child left or right - so on hover we need indicator on both sides  
- [ ] on drag connection to child side - on drop create child, on drag connection to parent - drop on canvas - create parent, on drop on come other child pin - reparent  
- [ ] compact nodes vertically/horizontally/all (remove all vertical/horizontal spacing between nodes - or both)  
- [ ] maybe isNodeIntersection could help us with AABB  
- [ ] vuefow help lines - can be useful for concept map  
- [ ] concept map resizable nodes  
- [ ] add classic vuefow controls (zoom in, zoom out, show all,  
- [ ] Edge types - default (bezier), step, smoothstep, straight. We can have also custom edge. See if smoothstep can have custom radius.  
- [ ] Collapse child number should show number of ALL child nodes (not only immediate child nodes)  
- [ ] Collapse number should be OVER THE CONNECTION POINT - not left/rigth of it.  
- [ ] see if bounding boxes can be turned on/of on node basis and if spacing can be adjusted on node basis.
