# MindScribble Product Description

## What MindScribble Is

MindScribble is a professional mindmapping application that solves the fundamental scalability problem of traditional mindmapping tools. Instead of creating monolithic mindmaps that become cognitively overwhelming with 100+ nodes, MindScribble enables users to create interconnected smaller mindmaps that form a personal knowledge network.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Cognitive Overload in Large Mindmaps
- **Traditional Problem**: Single mindmaps with 100+ nodes become unmanageable, causing mental fatigue and reduced productivity
- **MindScribble Solution**: Break knowledge into focused, smaller mindmaps (20-50 nodes each) connected via inter-map linking

### 2. Knowledge Fragmentation
- **Traditional Problem**: Related information scattered across multiple disconnected mindmaps
- **MindScribble Solution**: Create a networked knowledge base where maps reference each other, forming a personal knowledge graph

### 3. Data Ownership & Privacy
- **Traditional Problem**: Many mindmapping tools store data in proprietary formats or cloud services with unclear data policies
- **MindScribble Solution**: Store all mindmap data in user's Google Drive, ensuring complete data ownership and privacy

### 4. AI Integration Limitations
- **Traditional Problem**: AI features are limited or non-existent in most mindmapping tools
- **MindScribble Solution**: AI-first design with natural language commands for creating, expanding, analyzing, and reorganizing mindmaps

## How It Works

### Core User Experience
1. **Create Focused Mindmaps**: Users create smaller, purpose-driven mindmaps instead of monolithic structures
2. **Link Across Maps**: Connect related concepts between different mindmaps using reference edges
3. **AI-Powered Operations**: Use natural language to expand nodes, analyze structure, or reorganize content
4. **Multi-View Interface**: Switch between canvas (mindmap), writer (document), and tree (outline) views
5. **Master Map Visualization**: See all mindmaps and their connections in a D3 force-directed graph

### Key Workflows

#### Creating a New Mindmap
```
User: "Create a mindmap for planning a wedding"
AI: Generates root node "Wedding Planning" with 4-6 main categories
User: Expands specific nodes with details
User: Links to existing maps (budget, venue research, etc.)
```

#### Expanding Knowledge
```
User: "Expand the 'Budget' node with typical wedding costs"
AI: Adds child nodes for venue, catering, photography, etc.
User: Creates separate detailed budget mindmap
User: Links budget categories back to planning map
```

#### Analyzing & Reorganizing
```
User: "Analyze this project plan and suggest improvements"
AI: Identifies gaps, suggests restructuring by priority/timeline
User: Applies AI suggestions or manually reorganizes
```

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Intuitive & Powerful
- **Keyboard-first**: Rapid node creation, navigation, editing via keyboard shortcuts
- **Context menus**: Right-click for quick actions
- **Command palette**: VSCode-style Ctrl+Shift+P for all operations

### 2. AI-Augmented Workflow
- **Natural language commands**: "Create a mindmap for X", "Expand node Y with Z"
- **Smart suggestions**: Proactive AI recommendations while editing
- **Auto-complete**: AI helps complete node titles and content

### 3. Seamless Multi-View Experience
- **Canvas View**: Visual mindmap with drag-and-drop, LOD system for 1000+ nodes
- **Writer View**: Full document editor with rich text formatting
- **Tree View**: Hierarchical outline with keyboard navigation
- **Master Map**: Overview of all maps and connections

### 4. Data Sovereignty
- **Google Drive storage**: All data stored in user's drive
- **Offline support**: IndexedDB caching for offline editing
- **Export options**: JSON, PDF, PNG, SVG export capabilities
