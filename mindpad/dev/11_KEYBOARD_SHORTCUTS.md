files: alt+1, alt+2, etct.

views:
shift+M = mindmap
shift+W = writer
shift+O = outline
shift+T = timeline
shift+C = concept map
shift+K = kanban
Maybe these can be grouped into D3 views:
shift+S = sunburst
shift+P = pack (circle)
shift+G = gantt

calendar?
google map?

Is indexedDB ok for such an intensive use case?
Is there a better way to store and retrieve data?
Maybe we can use localbase? https://github.com/samuk190/localbase
It looks like a wrapper around indexedDB that provides a more convenient API.
