selection in mindmap - check why first click does not select node
selection in writer - editing should select node (in all views)
is it possible to make treeview editable? it is smart? (since we don't have html, it is not smart)

adding icons to nodes
<key>-select node with all children

writer - show/hide title
writer - command tool for nodes
writer - context menu for text

global search (keyboard shortcut) - like vscode

mindmap history (undo/redo)
mindmap - node grouping (expand/collapse group)
mindmap - multimap support - deep mapping

views: maybe also kanban & timeline would be interesting
